pymongo-pubsub â€” a publish-subscribe pattern implementation for pymongo
=======================================================================

Ever wished you could use your MongoDB to drive an event-driven environment?

Now you can.

pymongo-pubsub uses a round-robin *capped* collection to store its data on one
end and a *tailable* cursor to catch it as it is inserted on the other.

The publisher
-------------

A publisher is a piece of code responsible for pumping data into the database:


```python
import pymongo
from pymongo_pubsub import Publisher

connection = pymongo.Connection()
database = connection.pubsub_db

publisher = Publisher(database, 'test_event')
publisher.push({'message': 'hello world', 'answer': 42})
```

A `Publisher` will take care of setting up the underlying collection. You can
pass it optional `max_size` and `max_length` parameters to define storage
limits of the collection at the time it is created. The default size is
`1000000` bytes and the default length limit is `None`.

Make sure your queue is big enough to never overflow or you're going to start
losing data. You care about your data, right?

The subscriber
--------------

A subscriber is a piece of code responsible for processing data as it is pulled
from the database:

```python
import pymongo
from pymongo_pubsub import Subscriber

connection = pymongo.Connection()
database = connection.pubsub_db

def test_cb(data):
    print '{0:f}: {1:s}'.format(data['_id'], data['message'])

subscriber = Subscriber(database, 'test_event', callback=test_cb,
                        matching={'answer': 42})
subscriber.listen()
```

A `Subscriber` will never create any collections in the database and in case
the collections is missing it will cowardly raise a `KeyError` exception.
This is not a bug. This is to avoid having to synchronize collection limits
between the publisher and all of the subscribers.
